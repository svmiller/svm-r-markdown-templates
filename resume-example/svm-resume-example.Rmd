# Professional Experience

## World Championship Wrestling

- Successfully feuded with Booker T, elevating his singles career.
- Defenestrated on national television by Perry Saturn. It was technically a glass door, but I love the term "defenestration" and I don't get to use it much so I'm rolling with that.
- Career effectively ended at Superbrawl VIII (:()

## World Wrestling Federation

- Runner-up in 1993 Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal (to Razor Ramon).
- Wrestled Shawn Michaels to a countout draw in front of 80,000 fans in Wembley Stadium at Summerslam 1992.
- Carried Tito Santana like dead weight to tag team prominence, before [tiring of him at Wrestlemania V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKnWAxg4R68).
- Had two amazing entrance themes where somehow the least amazing of the two is [the one done by Robbie Dupree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bNr3144GDI).
- Successfully cultivated "The Model" persona, relocating to Cocoa Beach for a gimmick that was years ahead of its time.
- Launched successful line of cologne, *Arrogance*, and advertised it in [some amazing vignettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm9AbH7CnBc).
- [Temporarily blinded Jake "The Snake" Roberts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7sxJboGWA), incapacitating him for the better part of 1990.
- Successfully teamed with Tony Garea and briefly with Tom Zenk before Tom Zenk got apparently got weird about pay disparities.

## American Wrestling Association

- [Beat Jumbo goddamn Tsuruta for AWA World Heavyweight Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3O_jGZd6EI). 
- I'm going to make that another entry because seriously how cool is Jumbo as a proverbial notch on the belt? Jumbo Tsuruta was *the* Japanese pro-wrestler of the 1980s.
- Wrestled several matches with then-NWA World Champion Ric Flair.

## Other Territories

- Emerged as top talent in the Pacific Northwest territory for the NWA.
- Successfully teamed with Roddy Piper, winning a total of four tag team championships.
- Feature attraction in multiple territories in Canada (e.g. Stampede Wrestling), Puerto Rico (World Wrestling Council), and the United States (e.g. Georgia Championship Wrestling)
